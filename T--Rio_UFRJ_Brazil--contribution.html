                <div class="coluna-100">
                    In our project we designed a chimera protein, Ammit, which contains (quantos) different Dengue epitopes. In chimeric proteins, several pieces of polypeptides, from different origins,  are joined together. In order to separate these multiple protein domains, in natural proteins, spacers or linkers are used. These linkers can adopt different structures or functions, so the choice for the best linkers is an essential step involved in the design of the chimeric proteins.  To choose the best linkers for Ammit we performed  an extensive  bibliographic research, and searched the iGEM website to study  previous work related to this subject. We  found a page on the iGEM website that specifically talks about linkers that could aid the ligation between the different epitopes The linkers contained basic but important information, such as its constitution and brief description, ( PODERIAM COLOCAR QUAL PAGINA AQUI, CITAR ELA.), however some lack important information such as functionality, structural characteristics, and applicability. This information is extremely important to support studies related to the creation of chimeric proteins and other related research.

                <div class="coluna-100">
                    Given the importance of a more detailed description of linkers, the Osiris team chose four different linkers and decided to study and add to the website their characteristics in more detail, such as functionality and applicability. The chosen linkers were: BBa_J176131, BBa_K1486004, BBa_K648006 and BBa_K648007. All are represented with their respective iGEM codes, registered on the linkers page (access here).
                    <br>
        	        The team researched their descriptions, applicability, functionality, molecular data, etc. With this, we were able to find research carried out in scientific articles and patented works. We then added, for each one, a description aimed at its use in research projects, as well as its characteristics and interaction. In addition, we added the molecular weight of the proteins and their isoelectric point to help in the development of future scientific work involving the linkers in question.
                    <br>
        	        We hope that with this contribution, we can help future teams with the development of their work and research. Access below the page of each of the linkers with their additional descriptions:
                    (BBa_J17613)    (BBa_K1486004)	(BBa_K648006) 	(BBa_K648007)

                <div class="coluna-100">
                    During the creation and development of Ammit, the team identified some important points that must be taken into account when assembling and creating chimeric proteins. These points involve choosing sequences for joining, linker definition, structural modeling, docking simulation, and cloning. Therefore, we decided to build a Chimeric Protein Guide to help and facilitate work developed by future iGEM teams, involving all the points mentioned above. After a conversation with the XXX team, the team suggested addressing some other topics such as 3D protein structures and post-translational modifications. Since their work also involves the construction of chimeric proteins. The construction of the guide was described in more detail on our collaborations page (Access here).<br>

                    Descrições dos linkers:<br>
                    BBa_J176131: This linker was used in a study related to small molecule-mediated protein-protein interactions, where it is important to understand the abnormal signal transduction pathways in a variety of disorders, as well as to optimize the process of drug development and validation. The paper cites that the highest signal to background ratio was achieved for the split luciferase complementation system - Renilla based on fusion protein when linker peptides containing amino acids from EAAAR repeats were chosen. It was found that peptide linker with two or four EAAAR repeats showed greater signal mediated by protein-protein interaction with lower background signal compared to no linker or linker with amino acid sequences GGGGSGGGGS, ACGSLSCGSF, and ACGSLSCGS-FACGSLSCGSF. This linker was also cited in the US patent application for CAS9 FUSION MOLECULES, GENE EDITING SYSTEMS, AND METHODS OF USING THEM (Request # 20190136210) as an additional linker.<br>
                    Isoelectric Point: 6.39<br>
                    Molecular Weight: 2012.17Da<br>
                    <br>
                    BBa_K1486004: This linker is part of the group of flexible ligands composed of small, non-polar amino acids such as Gly and polar such as Ser. In this way, they guarantee high mobility and offer flexibility for the functional domains of connection. Studies show that when proline residues are exchanged in place of terminal glycine residues, degrees of independence are lost (Ruiz et al., 2016b). In this way, enzyme activity is decreased, which leads to low catalytic efficiencies. We can conclude that flexible ligands provide a reduced catalytic activity for proteins.<br>
        	        The article “Linkers: a synergistic way for chimeric proteins, 2020”, talks about the constitution and interaction of the flexible linker (Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Ser)n, where “n” specifies the sum of the repetitions of the residue. These linkers provide partial domain separation. It is possible to observe that the amount of Gly, Ser and Thr residues results in flexibility that allows the
                    mobility of the functional binding domains.<br>
                    Isoelectric Point: 5,52<br>
                    Molecular Weight: 648,59Da<br>
 
 
                    BBa_K648006: This linker was used in a very interesting article, entitled “Positive feedback in eukaryotic gene networks: cell differentiation by graded to binary response conversion”. The work addressed the use of the linker in question in the construction of genetic circuits. Being represented as a spacer region in the resulting rtTA-GFP fusion protein, obtained by in-frame insertion of the translated region of yEGFP into the KpnI site of rtTA. It has also been cited in a patent relating to a fc Receptor (fcrn) linking peptides and uses thereof. Where it has been described as a simple 10AA long fusion protein linker comprising glycine and serine residues, it can be used for the formation of cyclic dimeric peptides.<br>
                    Isoelectric Point: 4,00<br>
                    Molecular Weight: 1071,11Da<br>
 
                    BBa_K648007: This linker was cited in a very interesting article that talks about its high potential for use in "usefulness of tags and linker in plant molecular pharming", which can also be used in recombinant proteins. It was also cited in the American patent application for CAS9 FUSION MOLECULES, GENE EDITING SYSTEMS AND METHODS OF USING THEM (Request # 20190136210), as an additional linker, being a 6AA Medium Fusion Protein Linker.<br>
                    Isoelectric Point: 5,52<br>
                    Molecular Weight: 420,38Da<br>
